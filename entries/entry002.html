<!-- JOURNALING START!! -->
        <p>I mainly created this entry to test the buttons, to see if it showed and hid the entries correcty. But, now that I have created it, I can't just leave it like that, right? <i>Empty</i>.</p>
        <p>For now I'll just say, if my calculations are correct and everything works, this site should be up and running on Neocities by the end of the day :D</p>
        <p>BTW, IT'S THE FIRST OF THE MONTH. That's cool but also stresses me out because I have a tight deadline for an animation I'm making (I'll show what it's about some other day), but my ADHD won't let me do anything related to the project TT</p>
        <p>I HATE my procrastination, man. And I like animating for the project, my brain just likes to self-sabotagge???</p>
        <p>Anyway, I won't waste more time writing here, this was suposed to be sweet and short hehe, BYEBYE!!</p>
