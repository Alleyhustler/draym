    <h1>THE WORLD THE PROPHET DOESN'T KNOW</h1>
    <h2>THAT'S THE TITLE</h2>
<p>I'm not good with titles, just look at the title for my other fic!! <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/48991132" target="_blank">Shadow goes to the movie theatre with Sonic</a>, like, be for real.</p>
<p>So I snatched my title from the musical, because song titles definitely demonstrate my great skill as an author, hehe, he... Here are the lyrics from <i>No Longer You</i>, from The Underworld Saga:</p>
    <p style="text-align: center"><i>There is a world where I help you get home<br>But that's not a world I know</i></p>
<p>Yeah, that's it, the reference is pretty self-explanatory.</p>
<p>WHAT ISN'T AS OBVIOUS IS-</p><br>
    <h2>WHAT THE HECK IS MY AU ABOUT</h2>
<p>So, if I had to explain it in common Ao3 tags: <i>Alternate Universe - Everyone Lives/Nobody Dies</i>. Is that true?? Uhm... well, the <i>crew</i> doesn't die... There is the extermination of an entire race preety early on, since this would be more of a <i>Reverse Character Arcs AU</i>. What does that mean? A bunch of things:</p>
<ul>CHARACTERS WHO CHANGE IN MY AU
    <li>Odysseus starts as a monster and learns to embrace open arms (and he takes a WHILE, since in the musical he's still considering becoming a monster as he stabs Poseidon, with the line "maybe yiu could learn to forgive"). He is working towards not lying and not playing tricks.</li>
    <li>Polites is not as open arms as he seems. I'll leave it there.</li>
    <li>Eurylochus and the crew don't listen to Odysseus at first, but then learn to trust his captain.</li>
    <li>Athena is ok with his student taking different paths and doesn't platonically break up with him.</li>
    <li>Antinous and the suitors are nice. Plus, Antinous isn't interested in women, and he's only older than Telemachus by a couple of months (he doesn't have a canon age in The Odyssey, but many people believe he's like 10-15 years older).</li>
</ul><br>
<ul></ul>
<ul>CHARACTERS WHO STAY THE SAME
    <li>Telemachus. MY SHEILAAAAA. He's like 15 when I first make him appear 'cuz, yk, the crew gets home so much earlier, so he acts a bit more irrationally, but he's supposed to grow into the 20 year old baby we all know and love!!</li>
    <li>Polyphemus. They simply live because they didn't kill his sheep this time.</li>
    <li>Poseidon is chilling with the waves.</li>
    <li>Zeus is still sexually assaulting clouds (please, stop).</li>
    <li>Aeolus is still a menace.</li>
    <li>Hermes, though he dislikes Odysseus here. He's <i>the</i> trickster god, and Odysseus is trying to erase every part of his personality that made him interesting (the lying, stealing, manipulation...).</li>
    <li>Circe.</li>
    <li>Other minor characters such as Anticlea (Ody's mom), Eupeithes (Antinous' father), Palamedes, other Acheans (Diomedes, Menelaus, Agamemnon, Achilles, Patroclus, the Ajaxes), the Trojans (Paris, Helen and her clone Elen (shameless OC based on a hyper specific version of the myth where Paris doesn't kidnap Helen, but a clone of her made by Aphrodite, and Helen is actually in Egypt during the war), Hector, Priam...) the sirens, the monsters Scylla and Charybdis, the winions, other gods... Yes, everyone I mention appears in my fic in at least one chapter.</li>
</ul>
    
<br>
    <h2>HOW DOES THE STORY GO??</h2>
<p>You want me to spoil everything? Lol, I think the premise is pretty obvious (EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER), nothing goes wrong (EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER) and everyone lives (EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER) kind of fix-it AU (EXTREMELY LOUD INCORRECT BUZZER).</p>
<p>I encourage you to read it yourself!! Just... Mind the Trigger Warning</p>
<p>"Wait, what trigger warnings??"</p><p>"..."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"Alcohol abuse (including underage drinking), arson, extermination, drug abuse, heavy whitdrawal effects, panic attacks, self-hate, self-harm, internalized EVERYTHING, period-typical sexism, torture (kinda?), violence, non-con."</p>
<p>"Rom, what the fuck."</p>
<p>"But there's no <i>actual</i> smut!"</p>
<p>"That doesn't make it better. I'd argue it makes it worse. Shying away for this one aspect only makes it more boring."</p>
<p>"Shit, you're right..."</p><br>
    <h2>I STILL WANNA READ IT</h2>
<p>YOU DO!? It's still in the making! I'll add the link the second I start posting it on Ao3 ^^</p><br>
