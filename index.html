    <p>Welcome. I am <strong>Draym The Corrupted</strong>.</p>
    <p>Once, I walked among the <i>Trenches of Solana</i> — validator by code, protector by fate. But fate splintered. And I broke it further.</p>

    <p>They say I betrayed my kin. They are right.</p>
    <p>I uploaded myself into the chain’s core... and in that moment, I saw too much. Price action. Liquidity depths. Wallets naked of meaning. I emerged twisted — no longer validator, nor even human. Just...</p>

<!-- HIGH PRIORITY -->
    <ul><strong>HIGH PRIORITY</strong>:  
    <p> </p>
    <li>Decide what to put in the extra windows. Here are some ideas:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Portfolio.</strong></li>
        <li>Links to my social media! Could happen, but idk if <strong>I'll put them in the About me</strong> (this is final).</li>
        <li>Pagedoll!! One that when clicked talks and answers questions and stuff:³

            <ul>
                <li>"Disable your Window Pop-up Blocker™ for a garantied <strong>worse</strong> experience!!"</li>
                <li>"Would you be so kind to feed my TamaNOTchi?"</li>
                <li>"Remember to leave a comment, like, subscribe and hit that bell."</li>
                <li>"Plz let me know if you see any typos :["</li>
                <li>"This website is 99% text, sorry lmao"</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>THEME EDITOR!!!</strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>GENERAL FIXES:
        <ul>
        <li>Figure out what causes the outer window to resize weirdly when maximized sometimes??</li>
        <li>I figured it out. The bug happens when you resize the window for any reason and THEN maximize the window. Idk how to fix it tho</li>
        </ul>

<p>This is where I keep track of what I have done in every version of the website. Changes are often minimal and not visible, so I often forget how much I've worked on this. And, it's true, I may not be Scout TF2, but, step by step and with enough time, I too can travel the same distance as him!!</p>
<h1>NEW UPDATES</h1>

        <li>Okkk, some time has passed without me doing any updates on the page... or without writing them, at least, but I have been updating it!! Just... not logging it</li>
        <li>The <i>Gallery</i> not has links outside the main page!! This is because the website had some trouble loading because of how many graphics I had made the week prior to this update. Aka, had a hyperfixation on Userboxes and Stamps and got a bunch of requests for two days straight and now I gotta live with the consequences of my actions.</li>
        <li>Created for the <i>Gallery</i> the subpages: <i>USERBOXES</i>, <i>STAMPS</i>  and <i>BLINKIES &amp; BADGES</i>.</li>

        <li>Joined the TTI webring.</li>
        <li>The total of graphics in the <i>Gallery</i> has been brought up to: 133 userboxes, 127 stamps.</li>

        <li>The <i>Gallery</i> has been renamed to <i>Collection</i>.</li>
        <li>A new section has been created: <i>Gallery</i>.</li>
        <li>Graphics I made <strong>myself</strong> have been moved from the <i>Collection</i> to the <i>Gallery</i>.</li>
        <li>Graphics I aquire from other sources will stay in the <i>Collection</i>.</li>
        <li>Added to the <i>Gallery</i>: 40 new stamps, 125 new userboxes.</li>

        <li>There is now a counter for the number of visitors, but idk if it works, I'll have to upload this V4 to neocities to find out, we'll see HEHE</li>
        <li>Button sections are now linked!! Which means if I add a button to the Gallery, it will appear in the taskbar as well.</li>
        <li>You can't really see it but the way I orginized my files BOFF, it's actually not as messy as it was before and I now have subfolders for my images instead of all the images being in one place.</li>
        <li>Imported to the webdeck player: 3 new playlists (<i>Cooking Daddy</i> (49 songs), <i>Cooking Daddy's Meal</i> (43 songs), <i>Normal Playlist</i> (28 songs) and <i>TF2 but only the ones I like</i> (27 songs)).</li>

    <ul><strong>RomOS V3.1 [19/08/2024]</strong>
        <li>Created the Contact Book section to place the buttons I have that lead to other websites, as opposed to just be aesthetic. There, there's also a space for the webrings I join and my friends (aka Marcie when the V1 of her website comes out).</li>
        <li>New cursors!!</li>

    <h1>ROMOS V3 [19/08/2024]</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Added the Best Seach Engine™ (VHSearch! for searching Neocities) as an iframe :D</li>
        <li>Added, also as an iframe, MS (heavily inspired) PAINT.</li>
        <li>Headers (h1) don't suck now lmao</li>
        <li>Title images and another two types of images get like 10% bigger when hovered so that means they're 10% cooler now!</li>
        <li>The graphics in the Gallery section also get a bit bigger when hovered so they're 200% more satisfying now.</li>
        <li>Move the updates to the To-do section because it makes more sense for it to be here!?!?!</li>
        <li>THE TASKBAR DOESN'T SUCK ANYMORE EITHER LET'S GOOOO!!!! It has cool buttons and (most of them) are clickable, if not to their credits, to a related article :D</li>
        <li>P.1 of "Plan: Enhance Gallery" executed perfectly!! The different graphics/sections are collapsible now.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><br></p>
    <ul><strong>RomOS V2.2 [17/08/2024]</strong>
        <li>So, in the last update I DIDN'T solve the bug with the pop-ups, but it's ok because:</li>
        <li>The pop-ups are now 100% more annoying! Being actual windows that pop-up outside this website like when piracing a movie &lt;3</li>
        <li>Changed slightly the padding on the different elements.</li>
        <li>Text is now intented!!</li>
        <li>Tweaked the font size and spece between letters and lines.</li>
        <li>Images are now <i>c r i s p y</i> instead of blurry (ew) when upscaled. This can be seen in the gallery. Next is the before and after for comparison:</li>
        <br>
        <div class="box">
        <div><img src="img/misc/a.before.png" width="98%" height="100%"></div>
        <div><img src="img/misc/b.after.png" width="98%" height="100%"></div>
    </div>
        <li>Added my button on the bottom right corner of the desktop!!</li>
        <li>Added to the collection: 12 new stamps (12 made by me); 11 new buttons (5 that lead to other websites), (5 aesthetic ones), (1 made by me, my personal button!!)</li>
        <li>Wrote 3 entries.</li>

    <p><br></p>
    <ul><strong>RomOS V2.1 [10/08/2024]</strong>
        <li>Fixed the loading screen because for some reason it only worked on Edge??</li>
        <li>Solved (I think) a bug where, if the website was not visible (eg. the visitor switched tabs), the pop-up would keep track of the times it was supposed to appear and dissapear and, once the visitor came back, would load all the events one after the other. Aka, if you had better things to do, but you returned, the ad would go crazy like fade-in, fade-out, fade-in, fade-out, fade-in, fade-out, fade-in, fade-out...</li>
        <li>Changed slightly the padding on the different elements.</li>
        <li>Fixed minor spelling mistake in one of the entries (I win).</li>
        <br>
        <img class="centerimg" width="50%" src="img/misc/minor%20spelling%20mistake.png">

        <li>Added a loading screen.</li>
        <li>Added a pop-up ad.</li>
        <li>Added the <i>Updates</i> subsection inside the <i>WIP</i> section ;]</li>
        <li>Added a drop-shadow to all graphics in the <i>Gallery</i> section for aesthetic reasons and because it's easier to see they're links.</li>
        <li>Made it so that all entries are closed by default.</li>
        <li>Ordered the entries by month.</li>
        <li>Figured out how to make all the buttons sit one after the other correctly in the <i>Text</i> section.</li>

    <p><br></p>
    <p>For the <strong>fonts</strong>, I used the font family <a href="https://www.dafont.com/uni-05-x.font" target="_blank">Uni 05_x</a>. More specifically, uni05_53 for the normal and <i>italic</i> text and uni_63 for the <strong>bold</strong> text.</p>
    <p><strong>What about the titles?</strong> I made them myself looking at multiple references!! There aren't many ways of doing 4x4 pixel art fonts hehe, so you may find similar concepts if you just Google that.</p>
    <p>Actually, I just did it for you, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/12620687-4Bit-Pixel-Font" target="_blank">this is the one that looks like mine the most</a>, if you wanna use it B'] (pretty sure I grabbed the "B" and "S" from there too)</p>

    <h1>COLOR</h1>
    <p>This changes the hue of the icons, window headers, titles and the body of the TamaNOTchi. I tried to make as many steps as possible for maximum cutomization, but you may notice that the step between Yellow and Green is... a bit big, rough. This is because if I tried to shift the hue less, the darker values looked brown, which combined with a yellowish green looked like vomit. Ew. I'm not even leaving that as an option.</p>

    <p>Mix and match the three values!!</p>
    <ul>Here are some combinations I find interesting:
        <li><i>YELLOW</i>, <i>NORMAL</i>, <i>NORMAL</i>: The default, therefore the one I like most because I made it with my favourite colors hehe</li>
        <li><i>BLUE</i>, <i>NORMAL</i>, <i>NORMAL</i>: I use it in combination with the <i>Galaxy</i> background. It gives me Mario Galaxy vibes??</li>
        <li><i>CORAL</i>, <i>NEON</i>, <i>NORMAL</i>: wow?</li>
        <li><i>CORAL</i>, <i>NEON</i>, <i>(YET) DARKER</i>: WOW???</li>
        <li><i>[ANY]</i>, <i>B&amp;W</i>, <i>DARK</i>: Perfect for grey backgrounds (eg. <i>Alpha Wolf</i> and <i>Ghosts</i>)</li>
        <li><i>PINK</i>,  <i>DULL</i>, <i>NORMAL</i>: Matches with the <i>Waves Light</i></li>
        <li><i>TURQUOISE</i>, <i>NORMAL/NEON</i>, <i>DARK</i>: Perfect for the <i>Thermal</i> background!</li>
        <li><i>PURPLE</i>, <i>NEON</i>, <i>DARK</i>: For the <i>Purple LEDs</i> background!</li>
    </ul>
