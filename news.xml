  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ksvEd3v.png"></p><br><p>Hello!! It's been a while, I've had issues, like, things that need a bunch of TWs, probably. I may write about it in my journal.</p><p>Anyway, here are some updates!! Finally, after almost 3 months, damn.</p><p>Also, apparently there was another update I did (V5.2) that I didn't upload, so, uuuh, yeah. It's old, but you'll receive it now. Simply ignore it, I forgot what I wrote, I'm not fixing it.</p><ul><li>Updated the <em>About Section</em>: It's still horrible, I changed basically nothing.</li><li>Added to the <em>Sitemap</em>: Oh no, spoilers.</li><li>Added to the <em>Contact Book</em>: 1 new button (Cool Sites)</li><li>Created the window <em>News</em>: You can finally access both the RSS (cough, cough, ATOM) feed and The RSS Webring easily! (It's not obscured under the Updates in the To-do window)</li><li>Updated the <em>Theme Editor</em>:<br /><ul><li>Added the option to turn the <em>VHS Effect</em> on and off. Someone wrote in chat that they wished there was that option because it gave them headaches, and I thought they were so right!!</li><li>Updated the <em>Fonts</em>: Now, the text inside buttons changes as well!! Also, I fixed a problem with the padding-top on the MS Sans Serif font that was bothering me more than it probably should.</li><li>Added the option to make the <em>Image Rendering</em> pixelated or smooth, changing the crispiness of a background eheheh</li><li>Added the option to change the <em>Tile Size</em>&nbsp;to small (I'm sure the tiles have a great personality, ok, plus, it's not small, it's average), medium, and big.</li></ul></li><li>Created the window <em>Player</em>: The webplayer was kinda annoying in that corner for narrower screens (aka phones), so I'm placing it in a window now!</li><li>Added to <em>The RSS Webring</em>: One new member! Daryl.</li><li>Removed from <em>The RSS Webring</em>: 1 member, Hana. Her website disappeared for some reason. I'll contact her and ask what happened :(</li><li>Removed from the <em>Contact Book</em>: 1 button (Friends / Mutuals), Hana, the same girl I had to remove from the webring TT</li></ul>]]></content>

Aka, a login with a password is required to use that name and be able to delete messages, which should prevent spam and people pretending to be me (not that that's ever happened, but<em>I've seen it happen</em>on other neocities, so I believe it's better to be cautious).

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Jxmun33.png" /></p><h1>RomOS V5 IS HERE!!</h1><p>Before listing what I've been working on, I wanted to apologise for being pretty absent and not working on the page as much as I should.</p><p>I've been really busy with school, tomorrow (as of writing this) I have to do a presentation on <i>Animation: Technical concepts and process</i> and I'm really scared. This is 10% of the final grade, a project we've been working on for "two years" (they let us only one summer to actually work on it), and I feel really bad because I didn't manage to complete my goal in time, not even 50%. They supposedly don't take the level of completion into account because the thing that matters is the research you made and new stuff you learned along the way, but... Idk.</p><p>UPDATE: IT WENT GREAT!! I'm so happy :DD The jury told me I did a great job and my animation project was amazing HEHE.</p><p>Ok, ok, I'll stop yapping now:</p><ul><li>New window: <i>Sitemap</i>, if you ever get lost or don't know what a partucular window is/does, go there!!</li><li>New window: <i>Themes</i>, you can now customize some aspects of the desktop (for now, only available in the main page, not the subpages)</li><li>I have a <i>pagedoll</i> now!! Drag it around and click it to see what it says. I made three poses for it, one still, one for when it's being dragged around and once for when its talking.</li><li>This isn't really that important but in the <i>Chat</i> there's a guide for you to know from where I am sending messages. Why? <i>ionoh</i> (translation: I don't know, said while shrugging).</li><li>A pop-up will appear (if your browser doesn't automatically block them) every 5 minutes now. Before, they appeared after 2 minutes which was fine because I supposed people didn't stay in my page too long, but now I have more stuff and I fear they will become too intrusive (they already are a pain when I forget to close the tab overnight in my laptop).</li><li>Scratch the last point, it just ocurred to me that I can just put a max of pop-ups open at the same time so... There's a limit of 5 now.</li><li>I optimized a bit the CSS, JS and File Tree... which you won't be able to see or noticed, but took a while and I'm not even 10% on my plan to clean the spaghetti code (if you didn't know, I'm not a programmer, this is the first ever coding project I'm working on outside some games with Scracth in school which... you know, that's not really "coding").</li><li>VHS effect animation is now slower. The fast animation hurt my eyes, so I hope this is better.</li></li><li>COMMENT SECTION!! On each and every one of the entries.<li>Fixed size of the ads. They should adapt to the size of the window now.</li><li>Fixed gap between icons, text under them is easier to read now.</li><li>Fixed link to the <i>RSS Feed</i> subpage.</li><li>The <i>RSS Feed</i> subpage now has a navigation bar and it links to the <i>RSS Ring</i> subpage.</li></li><li>Added the subpages: <i>Art</i> and <i>Graffiti</i> (empty for now) to the <i>Gallery</i>.</li><li>Added the subpage: <i>Graffiti</i> (empty for now) to the <i>Collection</i></li><li>Added to the <em>Contact Book</em>: 19 new buttons (1 Friends / Mutuals (previously on Cool Buttons), 18 Other Cool Buttons). Updated 1 button.</li><li>Added to the <em>Gallery - Art</em>: 60 new art pieces (I think).<ul><li>FINISHED PIECES. 2024: 4 Character Designs for my animated project, 5 Background Illustrations for my animated project, 2 Others for my animated project, 6 Art Fight Attacks, 5 Personal Work. 2023: 37 Art Fight Attacks, 1 Personal Work.</li><li>SKETCHES. 2024: 4 Character Designs for my animation project, 7 Personal Work.</li>

For people who have RSS feeds for their personal websites and want to find other people with RSS feeds to follow.</li><li>Just expanding on the last point, making a webring was a PAIN. Not only did I have to learn three different programming languages (I forgot what they're called but the extensions were .php, .md, .scss, .toml and another one I don't remember), but THEN I made the ring with Netlify (thing I had never used before) and thought "I don't like the font of the index page" because it didn't let me import my pixelated font. So I deleted everything and tried to make one on my neocities directly, but I'm not pReMiUm (supporter), so I couldn't upload all the files, and Github (another thing I had never used before) was giving me problems. So I deleted everything again and used webri.ng, a platform that makes webrings for you with the click of a button. So my new knowledge wasn't even of use at the end :]</li><li>The Tales of a Programmer Noob, part #69.</li><li>Anyway...</li><li>You can't really see it, but I reorganized my folders and the files and the links are just a bit cleaner now on the different pages and subpages. This took so long...</li><li>Fixed a typo where one of the entries had [!] when it didn't have a TW.</li><li>Wrote 2 entries.</li><li>Added to the <i>Contact Book</i>: 1 webring (mine, blink blink), 1 friend / mutual, 4 other buttons. (I'M SO SORRY I TOOK SO LONG TO ADD THEM, I WAS WAITING FOR V.5 OF THE WEBSITE BUT STUFF HAPPENED WAA)</li></ul>]]></content>

  <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <ul><li>Fixed the loading screen because for some reason it only worked on Edge??</li> <li>Solved (I think) a bug where, if the website was not visible (eg. the visitor switched tabs), the pop-up would keep track of the times it was supposed to appear and dissapear and, once the visitor came back, would load all the events one after the other. Aka, if you had better things to do, but you returned, the ad would go crazy like fade-in, fade-out, fade-in, fade-out, fade-in, fade-out, fade-in, fade-out...</li> <li>Changed slightly the padding on the different elements.</li> <li>Fixed minor spelling mistake in one of the entries (I win).</li> <li>Added to the collection: 24 new stamps (14 made by me), 12 userboxes (12 made by me), 2 badges.</li> <li>Wrote 1 entry.</li></ul> ]]></content>
